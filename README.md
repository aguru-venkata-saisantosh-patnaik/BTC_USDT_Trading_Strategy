# Bitcoin Algorithmic Trading Strategy

## 📈 Advanced Multi-Regime BTC/USDT Trading System

A sophisticated algorithmic trading strategy for Bitcoin/USDT pairs that employs market regime classification, advanced noise filtering, and adaptive position management to achieve superior risk-adjusted returns in cryptocurrency markets.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project implements a comprehensive algorithmic trading strategy specifically designed for the volatile cryptocurrency market. The system achieves exceptional performance metrics through intelligent market regime detection and multi-layered signal filtering:

- **Sharpe Ratio > 6**: Superior risk-adjusted returns  
- **Maximum Drawdown < 15 %**: Effective risk management  
- **Time to Recovery < 100 days**: Quick drawdown recovery  
- **4-Year Backtested Performance**: Consistent outperformance across market cycles  

## 🏗️ Architecture & Strategy Design

### Market Selection Rationale

- **Bitcoin over Ethereum**: Superior liquidity, 30–50 % less volatility, larger market cap ($1.67 T vs $237 B)  
- **1-Hour Timeframe**: Optimal balance between signal quality and trading frequency  
- **56 % noise reduction** compared to 15-minute charts while preserving 78 % of intraday movements  

### Core Components

#### 1. Market Regime Classification System  
Categorizes market conditions into four states:  
- **BULL**: Hurst > 0.55, ADX confirmation, EMA alignment  
- **BEAR**: Inverse conditions for downtrend  
- **SIDEWAYS**: 0.4 ≤ Hurst ≤ 0.6, low ADX  
- **TRANSITION**: Undefined or shifting conditions  

#### 2. Advanced Noise Filtering  
- **Kalman Filter** for real-time smoothing (Q=1e-5, R=0.01)  
- **Heiken-Ashi Candles** to reduce whipsaw noise by ~38 %  
- **Hurst Exponent** (rolling 100 bars) for trend persistence  
- **Multi-indicator Confirmation** filters 70–80 % of false signals  

#### 3. Sophisticated Entry/Exit Logic  
- Multi-factor entry conditions across regime, momentum, volume  
- Regime-transition entries to capture emerging trends  
- Regime-specific exit strategies  

#### 4. Adaptive Position Management  
- **Position Sizing**: 50–100 % allocation based on signal confidence  
- **Leverage**: 1–2× depending on entry strength  
- **Risk-Adjusted Allocation**: Conservative during transitions, aggressive in trends

## 📊 Performance Metrics

- **Annual Returns**: Outperformed benchmarks in 3 of 4 years  
- **Quarterly Wins**: Beat benchmarks in 12 of 17 quarters  
- **Max Drawdown** < 15 % and **Time to Recovery** < 100 days  
- **False-Signal Reduction**: Filters ~75 % of noise  

## 🔧 Configuration & Parameters

### Kalman Filter

Q = 1e-5
R = 0.01

### Regime Thresholds

HURST_TREND = 0.55
HURST_SIDEWAYS = (0.4, 0.6)
ADX_THRESHOLD = 18

### Position & Leverage

POSITION_SIZING = {'primary': 100, 'transition': 50, 'short': 75}
LEVERAGE = {'primary': 2, 'transition': 1}
